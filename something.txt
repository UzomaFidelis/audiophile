I want to create client-side form validation for a checkout form created using react-hook-form-library. I am using the zod library for validation. The form has a 'payment method' radio option where one must be checked. The options are 'e-money' and 'pay-on-delivery'. There are also text input fields for 'e-money number' and 'e-money pin'. I want to validate the text input fields when the e-money radio option is checked but allow the form to pass when 'pay-on-delivery' is chosen (and the text inputs are not filled). Give me the code for the zod Schema i need to implement this.
